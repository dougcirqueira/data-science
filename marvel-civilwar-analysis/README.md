## Captain America: Civil War - Data Analysis

**Author: [Douglas Cirqueira](https://br.linkedin.com/in/douglascirqueira)**

**This project aims to evaluate which team is more popular based on Twitter data, #TeamCaptainAmerica or #TeamIronMan.**

**Data**
The data used to obtain the results is available on the files `tweets_captain.csv` and `tweets_ironman.csv`. Those tweets were obtained through the `search/tweets` endpoint from the [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public), using the following search queries:

- For Captain America: "#timecapitãoamérica OR #timecapitaoamerica OR #teamcap OR #teamcaptain OR #teamcaptainamerica OR #teamcapitain OR #teamcapitainamerica"

- For Ironman: "#timehomemdeferro OR #teamironman"

**Code**
In order to obtain the same results as I had, just run the file `civilwar_analysis.R`. This code has all the analysis steps performed.

**Plots and Images**
The plots and images shown on the analysis results are available in the directories `plots` and `images`.
